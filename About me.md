### **My interests and Passion**
I have an **average web expertise** and I'm a beginner in the field of coding. My creative drive pulls me towards crafting user journeys, not just building websites. 
Thus I'm more **excited to explore the depths of UX/UI** , beyond the boundaries of web development. 
Though I am interested in building beautiful user experience and interface designs, I also like to learn about and get my hands on various fields of engineering to expand my knowledge and develop my skill set.

### **My hobbies**
I enjoy reading and drawing. I like to learn new musical intruments and enjoy music the most. I used to be a classical dancer. I find peace in scribbling down my thoughts and ideas. I also love to learn new skills and facts.
