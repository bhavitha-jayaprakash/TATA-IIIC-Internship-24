# **TATA IIIC INTERNSHIP 2024**
#### _**Overview**_
- It was a week long internship (23/01/24-27/01/24) exclusively intended for the first year students of JECC.
- AIM: Provide insights into 3D printing and designing, Industiral robotics, Injection molding, and a one day industrial visit.
- We successfully completed our internship by dividing it into two enriching sessions for three days, a work-from-home day on 26th, and an IV on 27th.
- One session intoduced us into github, tinkercad, and creo while the other helped us to learn about pick and place and arc welding robots.
- We had hands-on experience on **_Yaskawa AR1440-Arc welding robot_**.
- We also completed an online course on *Yaskawa Safet Principles* offered by Yaskawa online training.
- Our intership was mainly led by Jinesh Sir, Sumesh Sir, Navin Sir, and Arjun Sir.

*A summary of our works in given below.*

## **Day 1**
- **Introduction to Github and Tinkercad** - *We designed a 3D house in Tinkercad and created a repostiory in Github for the internship.*
- _Tinkercad project - 3D House Designing_

- **Programming of Yaskawa AR1140-Arc welding robot and completed simple welding project.**

## **Day 4**
- **Work-from-home** - *Created this github file and an About me file.*

## **Day 5**
- **Industrial Visit** - *We visited two industries in Kallippadam- Vijaya Polymers and The Metal Industries.*
  
 1.Vijaya Polymers - Its a plastic injection molding workshop. They briefly explained about the processes, machinery and molds used. Fine plastic granules are melted at very high temperature and
