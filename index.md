# **TATA IIIC INTERNSHIP 2024**
#### _**Overview**_
- It was a week long internship (23/01/24-27/01/24) exclusively intended for the first year students of JECC.
- AIM: Provide insights into 3D printing and designing, Industiral robotics, Injection molding, and a one day industrial visit.
- We successfully completed our internship by dividing it into two enriching sessions for three days, a work-from-home day on 26th, and an IV on 27th.
- One session intoduced us into github, tinkercad, and creo while the other helped us to learn about pick and place and arc welding robots.
- We had hands-on experience on **_Yaskawa AR1440-Arc welding robot_**.
- We also completed an online course on *Yaskawa Safet Principles* offered by Yaskawa online training.
- Our intership was mainly led by Jinesh Sir, Sumesh Sir, Navin Sir, and Arjun Sir.

*A summary of our works is given below.*

## **Day 1**
- **Introduction to Github and Tinkercad** - *We designed a 3D house in Tinkercad and created a repostiory in Github for the internship.*
- _Tinkercad project - 3D House Designing_

- **Intoduced to robotic terminologies, basic operations and safety related to robots.**

## **Day 2**
- **Introduction to Creo** - *We designed 3D models in Creo.*

## **Day 3**
- **Designed various components of ball bearing - Outer & Inner race, cage, sphere and rivet, and assebled them in Creo.**

- **Programming of Yaskawa AR1140-Arc welding robot and completed simple welding project.**

## **Day 4**
- **Work-from-home** - *Created this github file and an About me file.*

## **Day 5**
- **Industrial Visit** - *We visited two industries in Kallippadam- Vijaya Polymers and The Metal Industries.*
  
 1. **Vijaya Polymers** - Its a plastic injection molding workshop. They briefly explained about the processes, machinery and molds used. Fine plastic granules are melted at very high temperature and injected into mold. Water is passed through the mold for cooling the extremely hot mold. High temperature is obtained with help of furnace. He is a classic example of a smart and innovative person with the heart of an engineer.

 3. **The Metal Industries** - It is a Kerala State public sector undertaking Unit established in the year 1928 perhaps the one among the first few pioneer industries in pre independent India and the first one in south India. The activities of the company are to manufacture and market various agricultural implements and tools required for agro farming, handicrafts and artisans community. The major clients of the products are Public and Government sectors.

They introduced us to processes and machinery of:
- *Furnaces* - Two types of furnaces are there- Coal and electric furnace. In coal furnace, high quality coal is used so that they do not break and will maintain a constant temperature. Electric furnaces are more efficient but not affordable when used for small scale production. Electric furnace can be of low or high temperature. It have 2 zones. Zone 1 with less heating operation due to opening and Zone 2 with more heating power.

  ![Electric furnace](https://github.com/bhavitha-jayaprakash/TATA-IIIC-Internship-24/blob/main/20240127_114620.jpg)

  Electric furnace have a controller that manages the system and also have a recorder that displays informations including a graph.

- *Plasma cutting* - Used for rail cutting. It is similar to hydraulic systems but use air instead of fluids.

- *Heat treatment* - It is done to enhance  strength and quality of steel. It is heated upto critical temperature and is a molecular rearrangement process. It does not have any automated machinery but is done manually under supervision of experienced staffs.

- *Power press*
